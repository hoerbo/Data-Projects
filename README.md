# Repository for Data Science Projects

This repository contains interesting projects from the **Data Scientist in Phython** course I am currently pursuing on dataquest.io.
The projects are sorted into subfolders and consist of *jupyter notebooks* and data sets.
The *.ipynb files are processed by github and can be viewed in the browser.

List of projects:

- Project 2: Identifying Factors for Viral Posts on the Hacker News Website
- Project 3: Exploring eBay Kleinanzeigen Car Sales Data
- Project 4: Finding Heavy Traffic Indicators on I-94
- Project 5: Data Visualization on Exchange Rates
