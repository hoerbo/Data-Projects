# Repository for Data Science Projects

Here I upload interesting projects from the *Data Scientist in Phython* course I am currently pursuing on dataquest.io.
The projects are sorted into subfolders and consist of *jupyter notebooks* and data sets.
The *.ipynb files are previewed by github and can be viewed by clicking on them.

List of projects:
